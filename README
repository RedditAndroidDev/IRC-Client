Setting up in Eclipse
---------------------

1. Add the IRC Client from Github.

2. Right click on it and hit "Import Projects..."

3. Use the "Import existing projects" wizard, click "Next" and "Finish" after that. If you get an error message, check your workspace. Looks like the project is already there. Make a backup and remove it.

4. Once you're done you have to add ActionBarSherlock. In the Git Repository view, extend "IRC Client" and "Working Directory" after that.

5. Right click on the folder "actionbarsherlock" and choose "Import Projects..." and follow the same instructions as before.

6. Now you should have both projects in your workspace. Right click on the imported "IRC Client" project in your workspace and select "Properties".

7. In this dialog you have to choose "Java Build Path" from the left and after that "Projects" from the top bar.

8. Click on "Add" and mark the checkmark next to ActionBarSherlock.

9. Now keep clicking on the OK buttons until you return to the main Eclipse view. You should be all set now.
